My Hello World From GitGHub!!
The fourth annual National Workplace Wellbeing Day takes place this Friday 13th of April, 2018.  The aim of the event is to raise awareness of the importance and benefits of healthier lifestyles, and to improve employee wellbeing by promoting better exercise and nutrition in the workplace.  This year’s campaign was launched by IBEC CEO, Danny McCoy who said, ‘There is much truth in the old proverb of the importance of a healthy mind in a healthy body.’
